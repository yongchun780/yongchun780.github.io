[Github](https://github.com/Lingduo-L/SpatialAnalysis_GIS.git)  
*Date*: February 2023

## About
- Leveraged the crowd-sourced Fatal Encounters dataset to unveil hidden patterns of police violence across New York City.
- Used **ArcGIS Pro** to create kernel density maps, unmasked high-incident hotspots, presented spatially views of urban violence.
- Employed GIS-based Ripley’s K method for **spatial analysis**, discerned a significant clustering of fatal encounters within a 17-unit distance and peak clustering at 6 units.
- Devised a sophisticated spatial analysis that accounted for background inhomogeneity, integrated population density and social vulnerability factors to refine the study’s precision, demonstrated an understanding of social vulnerability factors.
